# Mastermind Game with Genetic Algorithm🕹️
This project aims to apply a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Mastermind Game. The Mastermind Game in our study has 2 game modes: P(6,4) and P(8,5) in the limit of guesses of 10 and 12 turns, respectively.

## Objective🎯
- To decrease the average round of guesses as much as possible
- To decrease execution time usage

## Best Result⭐
### P(6,4): Pick 4 colors from 6 colors📍

## GA Method🌿
### Parent Selection 👨🏻‍👩🏻‍👧🏻‍👦🏻
- Tournament Selection
### Crossing-over Methods🧬
- Single-Point Crossover
- Two-Point Crossover
### Mutation Methods☣️
- Random Resetting
- Inversion
- Swap (Permutation)

### Hyperparameter🎚️
#define CROSSOVER_RATE 10  
#define MUTATION_RATE 10  
#define PERMUTATION_RATE 2  
#define INVERSION_RATE 3  
#define EHAT_POPULATION_SIZE 20  
#define POPULATION_SIZE 30  
#define MAX_GENERATIONS 20  
#define ELITSM_POPULATION_RATE 0.3  
#define FITNESS_THRESHOLD 0.0  
#define FITNESS_BLACK_VALUE 1.0  
#define FITNESS_WHITE_VALUE 1.0  

## Note📝
1. **CROSSOVER_RATE** is the ratio between single-point crossover and two-point crossover. Therefore MUTATION_RATE 10 means a 10% chance of using a single-point crossover and a 90% chance of using a two-point crossover (10/90)
2. **PERMUTATION_RATE** is the chance of being mutated by the **"swap mutation"** method
3. **ELITSM_POPULATION_RATE** is the rate of elitism from the eligible set
4. The eligible set noted by **"EHAT"**
5. The fitness value converges to 0 is better
